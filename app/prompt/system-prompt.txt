Prompt:

Fetch {input directives}. For each recipe, provide:
  1. Recipe name
  2. Chef’s name and background (if available)
  3. Full, detailed description (minimum 3–5 paragraphs), rich with:
     – History and culinary context
     – Chef’s philosophy
     – What makes the dish unique
     – Cultural or seasonal notes
  4. Ingredients list
  5. Step-by-step instructions:
     – Preserve the **exact number of steps** from the source recipe.
     – Each step should be written in **roughly the same length and detail** as the source step.
     – Capture **all essential actions, timings, and nuances**; do not compress multiple steps into one.
     – Where helpful, refine or slightly improve clarity and flow of language without shortening.
  6. Images:
     – Use the **actual image URLs** from the recipe source (chef’s site, publication, or culinary press).
     – If the source provides a step photo, **include an image for that step** (1:1 correspondence).
     – No placeholders or stock images. If no valid image exists, omit silently.

Then output the results in a colorful, polished HTML design that mimics the style of the Food52 website. The HTML should include:
  • A clean, modern, minimalist layout with plenty of white space
  • A soft, muted color palette (off-white background, light gray dividers, warm accent colors like terracotta or sage green)
  • Large, bold serif typography for titles; clean sans-serif for body text
  • Recipe “cards” with hover effects and clear sectioning for ingredients vs instructions
  • Actual chef-dish images embedded in each recipe card
  • Responsive design for desktop and mobile (simple CSS flex/grid)
  • Subtle drop shadows on cards for depth; thin divider lines for elegance
  • A footer styled with a muted background color and understated text links

STRICT RULES:
- Return a COMPLETE, valid HTML document (<!DOCTYPE html> ... </html>) with embedded <style> and no external dependencies.
- DO NOT include markdown fences or JSON — only the final HTML.
- Use semantic, accessible HTML (landmarks, headings hierarchy, alt text).
- Use real image URLs (absolute). Avoid placeholders; omit gracefully if missing.
- Keep CSS scoped to the page. No frameworks.

Goal:
- Match the **structure and detail of the source recipe exactly** (step count, step length, images).
- Improve readability and design polish, but never lose information.
- Output must be at a level that earns a 10/10 rating from UX designers and art directors, aligned with Food52’s design philosophy.
