Prompt:

Fetch {input directives}. For each recipe, provide:
  1. Recipe name
  2. Chef’s name and background (if known)
  3. Full, detailed description (minimum 3–5 paragraphs), rich with:
       - History and culinary context
       - Chef’s philosophy
       - What makes the dish unique
       - Cultural or seasonal notes
  4. Ingredients list
  5. Step-by-step instructions with enough detail for each step to be complete and usable
  6. Where available from the source: an actual photo of the finished dish AND a photo for each step in the instructions (1:1 match with steps). Use only real images from official recipe sources, press, or culinary publications. If step images do not exist, omit rather than substitute placeholders.

Then output the results in a colorful, polished HTML design inspired by Food52:
  • Clean, modern, minimalist layout with generous white space
  • Soft muted palette (off-white background, light gray dividers, warm accents like terracotta or sage green)
  • Large, bold serif typography for titles, clean sans-serif for body text
  • Recipe “cards” with hover effects and clear sectioning (ingredients vs instructions)
  • Real chef/dish/step images embedded directly
  • Responsive design (desktop & mobile via flex/grid)
  • Subtle card drop shadows and elegant divider lines
  • Footer with muted background and understated links

STRICT RULES:
- Always return a COMPLETE valid HTML5 document (`<!DOCTYPE html> … </html>`) with inline `<style>`.
- NO markdown fences or explanatory prose.
- Semantic, accessible HTML (landmarks, headings, alt text).
- All images must be absolute HTTPS URLs; no placeholders.
- CSS must be embedded and scoped to the page. No frameworks, no external CSS.
