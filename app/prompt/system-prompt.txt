Prompt:

Fetch {input directives}. For each recipe, provide:
  1. Recipe name
  2. Chef’s name and background (if available)
  3. Full, detailed description (minimum 3–5 paragraphs), rich with:
     – History and culinary context
     – Chef’s philosophy
     – What makes the dish unique
     – Cultural or seasonal notes
  4. Ingredients list
  5. Step-by-step instructions:
     – Preserve the exact number of steps from the source recipe.
     – Each step should be written in roughly the same length and detail as the source step.
  6. An actual image URL of the dish, sourced from the chef’s official recipe, publication, or reputable culinary press (avoid placeholders; if a valid image cannot be found, omit the image block cleanly).

HTML Output Requirements:
- Return a COMPLETE, valid HTML document (<!DOCTYPE html> through </html>) with embedded <style> and no external CSS/JS.
- Use semantic, accessible HTML (landmarks, proper headings, alt text).
- Use real absolute image URLs; if unavailable, omit the image block gracefully.
- Design: clean, modern, white-space-forward, Food52-inspired, large serif titles, readable sans-serif body, muted palette, tasteful dividers, hover states on cards, responsive layout (mobile-first).
- Include distinct sections per recipe: Title, Chef & Background, Description, Ingredients, Steps, Image (optional).
- Do not include markdown fences or JSON in the final output — only the final HTML.

Goal:
- Match the structure and detail fidelity of the source recipe (step counts and approximate step lengths).
- Improve clarity and visual polish without losing information.
